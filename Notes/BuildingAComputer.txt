# Signed numbers:

	- Establish a sign bit that leads a string of numbers:
		- 1 is negative
		- 0 is positive
	- These will always be the most significant bit of an integer
	

	- Sign magnitude:
		- the first bit is the sign, the rest of the number is the magnitude:
			- 1001 = -1
			- 0001 = 1

	- One's complement:
		- Sign magnitude can't be used for math, so this was developed
		- Method: Flip all the bits, sill using a sign bit
			- 0001 = 1
			- 1110 = -1

	- Two's complement:
		- One's complement can be used for math, but has two 0 representations (0000, 1111)
		- Two's complement solves this
		- Method: Flip all the bits and add 1
			- 0001 = 1
			- 1110 (flip the bits)
			 +0001 (add 1)
			- 1111 = -1
